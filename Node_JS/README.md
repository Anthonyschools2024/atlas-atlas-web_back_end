Atlas Web Backend - Node.js ProjectThis repository is my journey into the world of server-side development using Node.js. The primary goal is to master the fundamentals, from running basic JavaScript files to building a complete web application with the Express framework.Learning ObjectivesBy the end of this project, I will be able to confidently explain and demonstrate the following concepts:How to execute JavaScript using Node.js.The Node.js module system (require, module.exports).Using built-in modules, specifically for file system operations (fs).Accessing command-line arguments and environment variables via the process object.Creating a basic HTTP server with the http module.Building a more robust server with the Express.js framework.Defining simple and advanced routes in Express.Using modern JavaScript (ES6) with tools like Babel-node.Improving the development workflow with Nodemon.Writing tests and ensuring code quality.RequirementsEnvironment: Ubuntu 18.04 LTSNode Version: 12.x.xCode Editor: Visual Studio CodeLinting: ESLintTesting: JestAll files must end with a new line, use the .js extension, and pass all linting and testing checks.Project Tasks & My ProgressHere, I'll keep track of the completed tasks and what I've learned from each one.0. Executing basic javascript with Node JSFile: 0-console.jsStatus: CompleteWhat I learned: This was the first step. I created a simple function and successfully exported it using module.exports. This task solidified my understanding of how Node.js encapsulates code into modules and how to share functionality between different files. It's the most basic building block.(This section will be updated as more tasks are completed.)How to Use This ProjectClone the repository:git clone <your-repo-url>
